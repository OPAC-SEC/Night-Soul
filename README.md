# ☠️ Night-Soul ☠️
*The Ultimate DoS Arsenal – Unleash Chaos, Test Your Limits*

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-UNSTOPPABLE-red)

**Night-Soul** is a next-level Denial-of-Service (DoS) framework engineered for elite red team operatives and penetration testers. This beast pushes systems to their breaking points by launching multi-vector attacks—from raw TCP SYN floods (powered by Scapy) to advanced HTTP/HTTPS request floods and relentless Slowloris strikes.

> **⚠️ LEGAL NOTICE:** This weapon is for **authorized cybersecurity testing, red teaming, and penetration testing only.** Unauthorized use is illegal and will be met with full force. Use responsibly.

## ⚡ FEATURES & VIRTUOSITY

- **🚀 Multi-Mode Attacks:**  
  - **Basic DoS Attack:** Rain down randomized HTTPS requests to overwhelm targets.  
  - **Firewall Bypass DoS Attack:** Merge raw SYN floods with HTTPS strikes to break through basic defenses.  
  - **Full Security Bypass DoS Attack:** Employ payload obfuscation (XOR + Base64), dynamic spoofing, and randomized injections to dismantle advanced security.  
  - **Slowloris Attack:** Establish and maintain persistent, slow connections to exhaust server resources.

- **🔫 Raw SYN Flooding:** Uses Scapy to deliver low-level TCP SYN packets (requires admin/root privileges).

- **🌐 HTTPS Request Flooding:** Leverages custom SSL contexts and randomized HTTP headers to simulate legitimate traffic while causing havoc.

- **🛡 Payload Obfuscation:**  
  - **XOR Encoding:** Camouflages payloads with a secret key.  
  - **Base64 Encoding:** Encodes data to evade simple inspection.

- **🎭 Randomized HTTP Headers:** Generates dynamic User-Agents, spoofed IP addresses, and custom headers to bypass filters.

- **🕵️‍♂️ Proxy Support:** Integrates SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies (load extra proxies from `proxies.txt`) for stealth and anonymity.

- **⚙️ High Concurrency:** Utilizes Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to launch thousands of threads/connections, limited only by your system's capabilities.

- **💥 Killer Visuals:** Displays an epic ASCII banner (via PyFiglet) and colorful logs (thanks to Colorama) to keep you in the zone.

## 🛠️ REQUIREMENTS

- **Python 3.x**  
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/)  
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/)  
- [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet)  
- [Colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)  
- Standard libraries: `socket`, `ssl`, `base64`, `threading`, `concurrent.futures`, etc.

*⚠️ Note: For raw SYN floods, run with elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo python dark_reaper_soul.py` on Linux). Boost your open file limits (`ulimit -n 65535`) for massive concurrency.*
